    <!-- 
    This file can represent an alternate configuration setup for developers.
    
    It is part of a larger (optional) workflow that can help to 
    support multiple distinct deployment configurations for a single louie-based project.
    
    In this workflow, we make use of the LouieProperties config parser's ability to re-direct to another file.
    If you look at the "dev" profile in the server project pom file, you'll see the usage of the "dev-prep" goal
    on the louie plugin. When this profile is activated, during packaging the "dev-prep" goal will swap out 
    the embedded louie.xml file with an alternate file which points to your supplied <devconfigpath> argument
    In the simplest case, it will point to this file (and which you should therefore fill). This allows
    you as the developer to specify a customized development configuration which won't impact the default
    embedded louie.xml (which could represent your production configurations).
