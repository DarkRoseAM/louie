Caching

* {{{http://code.google.com/p/guava-libraries/}Guava}} 
 
 For in memory caching and in client side libraries we are using Guava for caching. 
Guava provides a ton of features, a caching framework is just one small portion. 
With Guava you can create LRU based caching structures that abstract the actual lookups.
